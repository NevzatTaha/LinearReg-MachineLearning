# LinearReg-MachineLearning
Hello,
This project aims to make a prediction about charges which is individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
Hence, I have created new features and reshaped my dataframe. Although, there is not a high correlated data with charges, I have found about 70% accuracy.
Therefore, if you have any idea that improve my project, I am always here to get advice.
